What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Creates a hidden directory called .git that stores meta-data and version history as changes are made through git

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is unsaved until committed to repository. It allows for multiple files to be grouped together before adding a commit with them all.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By grouping modified files together for a particular commit

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches are useful for experimental features, localizations, and other significant deviations from the master branch. They also preserve the state of the master/parent branch at the time the child branch is created so that updates to the parent branch do not "break" interactions with previously created branch children.

HELPFUL COMMANDS TO REMEMBER
git log --graph --oneline master coins (compare visually branches)
git checkout -b new_branch_name (checks out current staging area into new branch so that it is "reachable"/saved, and not lost when checking out another branch)
