What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Creates a hidden directory called .git that stores meta-data and version history as changes are made through git

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is unsaved until committed to repository. It allows for multiple files to be grouped together before adding a commit with them all.
